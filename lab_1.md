**Lab Assignment 1**  
**Finite Difference Scheme. Error Estimation for Finite Difference Schemes.**

---

### **Goals**:
Learn how to discretize a continuous mathematical physics problem, identify sources of error, and evaluate the error of a numerical scheme.

---

### **Problem Statement**:
Develop a finite difference scheme for the Lotka-Volterra system of equations ("predator-prey"), which describes the dynamics of a simple ecosystem:

\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = x(a - y), \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = -cy + bxy
\]

Where:  
- \( x \): nondimensional prey population,  
- \( y \): nondimensional predator population,  
- \( b, c > 0 \): positive constants (\( b < 1 \)).

---

### **Steps to Complete the Assignment**:
1. **Select a Numerical Scheme Template**:  
   - Choose a finite difference stencil for expressing the equations in the "time-population" coordinate system.
   - Represent population at any given moment as a vector \( \mathbf{z} = (x, y) \).  
   - Include the chosen stencil diagram in your report.

2. **Write the Numerical Scheme**:  
   - Discretize the equations using finite differences to create the numerical scheme.
   - Use the method of undetermined coefficients to achieve the required accuracy.

3. **Estimate the Numerical Error**:  
   - Derive the error analytically, expanding neglected terms in a Taylor series.
   - Analyze and draw conclusions about the relationship between the error and the time step size (\( \Delta t \)).  
   - Plot a qualitative graph of the error versus step size, considering both computational round-off errors and truncation errors.

4. **Implement and Test the Scheme**:  
   - Compute a few steps of the numerical scheme.
   - Plot the population dynamics over time.

### **Report Contents**:
1. **Template of the Numerical Scheme**:  
   - Diagram illustrating the finite difference stencil.

2. **Discrete Numerical Scheme**:  
   - Formulas for computing the next time step.

3. **Error Estimation Formulas**:  
   - Expressions for the error as a function of the time step size (\( \Delta t \)).

4. **Results**:  
   - A graph showing population changes over time. Optionally, include a table of values.
